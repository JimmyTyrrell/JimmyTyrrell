- 👋 Hi, I’m @JimmyTyrrell, a Computer Science student at University of the People.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and cybersecurity, and in improving social media to better accord with human interests over commercial ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hardware logic and logical architecture in university, and taking various courses in IT, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Machine Learning, and front-end design on other platforms.
        I'm active on Sololearn, Simplilearn, Codecademy, and Coursera. 
- 💞️ I am finally at a point where I feel ready to contribute to some team projects.
        My Java is ok, my basic Python is good, and I have looked into Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and SKLearn via the Sololearn courses on Data Science and Machine Learning.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
