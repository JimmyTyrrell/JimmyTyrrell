- 👋 Hi, I’m @JimmyTyrrell, a former postal worker who is revisiting their childhood interests in coding and computer science, and initiating a career shift.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and cybersecurity, and in improving social media to better accord with human interests over commercial ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on various platforms, and taking various courses in IT, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Machine Learning, and front-end design.
        I'm active on Sololearn, Simplilearn, Codecademy, and Coursera. 
- 💞️ At the moment I don't think I'm ready for any major collaborations. My coding skills are still fairly elementary.
        I've got a couple class projects I'm working on that I hope I'll be able to develop into something useful for the general public, but I haven't put anything on
        GitHub yet.
